# Vigenere
Vigenere cipher implementation in C. Pretty simple overall and really easy to compile. It is a single file so you can use whatever compiler you want. Easiest thing to do is just clone it into CLion and build it from there but if you want you can just clone it and compile the main.c file itself.
